# Welcome to the Beacon AI React Assessment!

This is a basic React project which you will change however you want to achieve the goal below.

## Setup Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to update packages.
3. Run the project locally with `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`.
4. The rest is up to you! Make code changes and commits as you see fit.

## The Goal:

Create a page with a clock, a timeline, and multiple displays. You will be displaying the state of an aircraft as it changes over time based on the `time-series-data.json` file.

Take this opportunity to show off your component building style, file/folder organization, and overall skill and familiarity with React! Feel free to use React tools and external libraries. Additionally, be sure to demonstrate how you like to do state management!

Please **_do not_** use component libraries or styling libraries. (MUI, Bootstrap, etc.) Show us your HTML and CSS skills!

1. Build a clock
   - Play
   - Pause
   - Restart
   - View current time
2. Build a timeline
   - Click / slide / scrub along the timeline to update the time (picture the timeline at the bottom of a video player like YouTube)
   - As the clock updates, so does the timeline, and vice-versa
   - The time range should match the range of timestamps from the `time-series-data.json` file
3. Visualize the data currently indicated by the clock.

We expect this project to take around 3 hours, but feel free to spend more or less time as you see fit.
